## What should you pay attention to when looking for an internship?

# From Intern to Tech Talent Acquisition: My 4-Year Journey at Jumia: A Personal Reflection on Growth and Opportunity
As I approach my fourth year at Jumia, Africa's leading e-commerce platform, I want to share insights from both sides of the recruitment table - from starting as an intern to now leading tech talent acquisition across our tech hubs in Portugal and Egypt.

**Our Internship Culture:**

At Jumia, internships aren't just programs - they're fundamental to our DNA. We deliberately mix experienced professionals with fresh talent across all our teams - Software Engineering, Data, Security, and beyond. This blend of experience and fresh perspective shapes our innovative culture and drives our success.

**Impact Through Numbers:**

In less than a year of managing our internship program, we've welcomed over 85 talented individuals. The impact? Transformative. Nearly 90 bright minds have joined our teams, each bringing unique perspectives and energy to our tech ecosystem.

**Global Talent, Local Impact:**

Our talent pool spans more than 30 universities across Europe. With about 55% of our interns coming from abroad - including Italy, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, France, Croatia, Austria, Spain, and The Netherlands - we're building truly diverse teams. Our strongest intake has been in Finance, Software Engineering, and Product Management, reflecting our commitment to comprehensive tech excellence.

**Beyond the Paper Qualifications**

Let me be clear: While prestigious universities are great, they don't define your potential. Your worth isn't measured by a certificate but by your passion, adaptability, and drive. We've seen extraordinary talent emerge from diverse educational backgrounds, proving that potential knows no boundaries.

# **Practical Success Strategies:**

## ***Professional Presence:***

✅	**Craft a concise, impactful one-page CV:** Kind reminder - when you're starting your career or making a career switch, keep it to one page. Trust me, that's plenty of space to showcase your potential. Here's my go-to advice: 'Keep your CV clean and concise, but let your LinkedIn tell the full story.' And yes - if you include your LinkedIn on your CV, I'll definitely check it out! Make sure both platforms work together to present your best professional self. Think of your CV as the highlight reel and LinkedIn as the behind-the-scenes documentary. Both matter, but they serve different purposes in telling your professional story.

✅	**Develop strong English communication skills:** Let's talk about the game-changer in your career journey - English proficiency. Want to work for international companies? English fluency isn't just a nice-to-have - it's essential. Speaking from personal experience, investing in a 6-month intensive English course can transform your career prospects. I did exactly this before applying to Dutch universities, aiming to ace the IELTS exam, and it made all the difference. Pro tip: Intensive language courses are worth every minute and penny. They fast-track your learning and boost your confidence in professional settings. Think of it as investing in your career passport - it opens doors worldwide.

✅ **Research thoroughly before interviews:** Here's a crucial tip that many candidates overlook - do your homework before that screening call/first interview! When a company reaches out, and you're moving to the first round, take time to research them properly. Yes, this sounds basic, but you'd be surprised how many skip this step. Trust me - it makes a huge difference, and you control whether that difference is positive or negative. Quick reality check: Walking into an interview knowing only the company name versus understanding their mission, recent projects, and market position? That's the difference between showing genuine interest and just going through the motions. Remember: In those first conversations, your level of preparation speaks volumes about your motivation. It's one of the easiest ways to stand out - either for the right or wrong reasons. Make it count!

✅	**Master structured communication using the context-development-outcome framework:** If you are not able to expose yourself, nobody else will do it for you; when being interviewed, be structured, try to follow a “context-development-outcome” reasoning line, e.g., bringing real-life examples to the conversation (group/individual academic projects), they'll reveal your Impact on tasks performed so far - follow the [STAR Method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method)!


## ***Career Development:***

✅	**Be transparent about your aspirations:** Be real about your career goals - it's refreshing and actually works in your favor. When discussing your aspirations, don't be afraid to share both what excites you AND what doesn't quite spark your interest. Think you might not like certain aspects of a role? Say so. Love specific types of projects? Let them know! Even if you're not 100% sure (hey, who is when starting out?), sharing your honest thoughts helps both you and the employer make better decisions. Remember: There's no 'right' or 'wrong' in career preferences - there's just what works for you. Being upfront about these preferences early on helps avoid mismatched expectations and leads to better career fits.

✅	**Keep your options wide:** Your first role isn't your forever role. Starting in one area doesn't lock you into that path. Think of it as your launching pad, not your final destination. Maybe you start in Quality Assurance but discover a passion for Product Management, or begin in Data Analytics but find yourself drawn to Software Engineering. That's not just okay - it's actually pretty common in tech! The key? Stay open to possibilities. If you're looking for an internship, starting at B doesn't mean you can't get to A in a few months.

✅ **Don't put all your eggs in the LinkedIn basket:** While LinkedIn is great, there's a whole world of opportunities on platforms specifically designed for early-career talent (such as Erasmusintern or Graduateland). Each platform has its unique strengths, and using multiple channels significantly increases your chances of finding the right opportunity. I'll share a detailed list of platforms below that could be game-changers in your job search.

✅	**Embrace international experiences and perspectives:** If you get the chance to travel, grab it! Whether it's a study abroad semester, an international internship, or just backpacking between jobs - these experiences are pure gold for your personal and professional growth. Why does it matter? Every conversation with someone from a different culture adds a new perspective to your toolkit. Those moments of figuring things out in unfamiliar places? They're building your adaptability and problem-solving skills - exactly what employers love. Think of international experience as more than just travel - it's about developing a global mindset, understanding different work cultures, and building an international network. These experiences often become your most compelling interview stories and can set you apart in your career. Remember: In today's connected world, the ability to work with diverse teams and understand global perspectives isn't just nice to have - it's increasingly essential.

## ***Personal Growth:***

✅	**Build resilience against rejection:** Rejection is part of every professional (and personal) journey - especially when you're starting out. The key isn't avoiding rejection; it's building the strength to bounce back from it. Think of each 'no' as redirecting you toward your eventual 'yes.' Sometimes, the role you didn't get leads you to an even better opportunity down the road. I've seen it happen countless times (including myself). Remember: A rejection isn't a reflection of your worth - it's often about timing, fit, or circumstances beyond your control. The candidates who succeed aren't the ones who never face rejection; they're the ones who learn from it and keep moving forward. Worry about things you can control.

✅	**Actively seek and implement feedback: ask for it when not given:** Don't just accept feedback - seek it out actively. It's your fast track to improvement. Whether it's a yes or no, always ask what you could do better next time. The most successful people aren't just good at receiving feedback - they're hungry for it.

✅	**Develop your professional network: a position that is not open today may be open tomorrow:** Today's connection could be tomorrow's opportunity. Keep building meaningful professional relationships, even when you're not job hunting. That role you want might not exist today, but when it does, you'll want to be the first person they think of.

✅	**Maintain confidence in your capabilities:** Don't be your own biggest obstacle. You've got skills, potential, and unique qualities that make you valuable. Own that truth. Sure, rejections can shake your confidence. That's normal. But here's the deal: One 'no' (or even several) doesn't define your capabilities. Sometimes, it's just about fit, timing, or circumstances beyond your control. Remember this: Your capabilities aren't diminished by rejection. Keep your head high, acknowledge your strengths, and stay focused on your goals. 

## ***The Interview Process:***

✅ When interviewing, structure your responses using real examples from academic or personal projects. Show us your impact, your problem-solving approach, and your ability to learn and adapt.

## ***Communication is Critical:***

✅ Articulate your thoughts clearly and confidently. No one else can tell your story better than you. Share your experiences, challenges overcome, and lessons learned.

## ***Mindset Matters:***

✅	Stay positive through rejections

✅	View setbacks as learning opportunities

✅	Keep your options open

✅	Build resilience through self-awareness
